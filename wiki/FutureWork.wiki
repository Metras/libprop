= Future work =

 * Need to model non-line-of-sight diffraction over objects at specific frequencies.
 * Need to model multiple diffraction sources along path.  Right now we simply subtract the worst loss caused by any single Fresnel violation.
 * Need to consider reflection off bodies of water and over specific families of trees.
 * Need to further examine the impact of land-use attenuation after getting access to TIA document.
