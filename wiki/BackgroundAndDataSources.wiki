Radio propagation analysis describes how radio signals move through a given area.  Given a set of known radio equipment and two specific locations, we can model the environmental conditions between those points to determine if successful radio communication is possible.

= Data Sources =

The USGS is an excellent source of digitized terrain data, and they continue to improve data quality and resolution as technology allows.  Currently they are offering 10-meter resolution data for the entire United States, which is what libprop usually expects.

libprop can accept data in either the GridFloat or BIL (integer) formats from USGS, and it understands native lat/long mapping and Albers projection.  For terrain data we recommend using "[http://seamless.usgs.gov/products/9arc.php National Elevation Dataset (NED) 1/9 Arc Second]" data source, which provides 10-meter resolution.  We also recommend the "[http://www.landfire.gov/NationalProductDescriptions23.php Landfire Existing Vegetation Cover]" and "[http://www.landfire.gov/NationalProductDescriptions22.php Landfire Existing Vegetation Height]" data sources which provides vegetation type and height information.  Optionally, we can accept the "[http://seamless.usgs.gov/products/nlcd01.php National Land Cover Dataset 2001]" data source which provides land-use classifications.  Our algorithm doesn't use this data by default.
